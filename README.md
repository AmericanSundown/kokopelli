About
=====
`kokopelli` is a tool for computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM).

It uses Python as a hardware description language for solid models.  A set of core libraries define common shapes and transforms, but users are free to extend their designs with their own definitions.

The CAM tools enable path planning for two, three, and five-axis machines.  At the moment, paths can be exported to Universal and Epilog laser cutters, the Roland Modela mini-mill, three and five-axis Shopbot machines, and plain G-code.  A modular workflow system makes adding new machines easy.

In addition, models can be saved as `.svg` and water-tight `.stl` files.
